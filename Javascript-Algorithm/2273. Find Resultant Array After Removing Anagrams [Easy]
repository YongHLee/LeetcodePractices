Once you sort each string by spliting into array and sorting, you can compare each array to the previous one. If they are same, you know the current
array should not be in the final answer. If they are not, memorize the currrent index by pushing it to a stack. Once you have iterated through all words, 
aggregate only words that are in indexStack.
