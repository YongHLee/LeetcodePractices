/**
Most importantt concept in this problem is keep a the balance of '(' and ')' by assigning 1 and -1 to each. This way if balance value < 0, we know 
there is extra ')' and we should not include it in the final answer. Once you have excluded extra ')' we should have 'balance' value >= 0. Make another
pass on the string to remove extra '(' this time.
