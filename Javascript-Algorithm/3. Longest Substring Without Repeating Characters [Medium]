/*
We want to using sliding window technique to see if a repeating letter exist in our substring. First keep track of letters and their frequency in a map. 
Each time we iterate though s[i], update the letter's frequency. Then we check if any letter is the letter frequency has > 1, which means there was a 
repeated letter. If this happened, we need to slide the "sliding window" by one index. This involves removing the first element of the sliding window and 
update the letter frequency map accordingly. first element of the sliding window is s[i - subStrLength].
