/*
We want to "Write an SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments." 
This means we need to SELECT from Employee and join Department on departmentId = Department.id. Once this is done, we want to make sure to choose
employee with highest salary of each department. Use "in" clause to choose departmentId and salary in list of departmentId and maximum salary of
department. You can query departmentId and maximum salary by using MAX() and grouping by departmentId.
